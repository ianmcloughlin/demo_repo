A demonstration repository for teaching.
This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
You should refer to that documentation for more information on writing an appropriate README for visitors to your repository.
